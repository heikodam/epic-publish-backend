# My Project:
Go on the Website fill out a form to post an Ad to rent our your Apartment. The Web App should then post it on the different marketplaces (eg. ebay-kleinanzeige, immobilienscout24, immowelt...).

## How far did I get?
One is able to create/edit/delete an account, ads and Marketplaces. But the functionality of publishing the ads on the marketplaces I have not started yet.
